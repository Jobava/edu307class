            <h4>Site Configuration</h4>
            The <strong>Site Configuration</strong> section is only available to administrative users of your website. If you’re not an author with admin rights to the site, you won’t be able to see <strong>Site Configuration</strong> in the navigation when you sign in.

            On the main page, you can make basic adjustments to your site, like changing the site name and site description.

            To adjust the number of published updates that are displayed on each page of your stream, change the number for “<strong>items per page</strong>.”

            If you want others to be able to sign up freely as site authors, you can turn on registration for your site. This is turned off by default. Once on, anyone will see a “<strong>register</strong>” link when they visit the site. With this link, they can sign up as a new user.

            <h4>Turn on plugins</h4>
            The “<strong>Plugins</strong>” section lets you turn on or off plugins that are included with Known. Plugins are small modules of software that add extra functionality to the core Known platform. Some plugins are turned on by default when you create your site. These include the content types that you see at the top of your home stream when you sign in.

            You can enable a plugin by turning on the button next to it in the plugins list. Repeat to disable the plugin if you want to turn it off. Plugins that say “labs” in the description are experimental alpha versions and may not contain full features.

            <h3 id="change-the-theme" class="guides anchored">Change the theme</h3>
            The “<strong>Themes</strong>” section allows you to change the way your site looks. Themes potentially include different layouts, colors, and fonts that are applied to the appearance of your site. To use a specific theme for your site, click the “<strong>enable</strong>” button by that theme. The style will then be applied to your site. Some themes include their own settings to further customize the appearance of the site.

            <h3 id="publishing-posts" class="guides anchored">Publishing posts</h3>
            <img class="img-guide" src="https://withknown.com/guides/beginner/img/post.png" alt="Publish a post" />

            Posts are a great way to publish an essay or a blog article. Posts let you publish longer pieces of content, and you can embed media like YouTube videos or audio clips from SoundCloud into posts.

            By default, there are two views for typing your post, the rich text view and the plain text view.
            <h4 id="using-the-rich-text-editor" class="guides anchored">Using the rich text editor</h4>
            <img class="img-guide" src="https://withknown.com/guides/beginner/img/richtext.png" alt="Using the Rich Text Editor" />

            The rich text editor - also known as a WYSIWYG editor (for What You See Is What You Get) - provides a formatting toolbar for your writing.
            <h4 id="formatting" class="guides anchored">Formatting</h4>
            The “Formats” dropdown gives you most of the options for formatting your text, including inserting different types of headers, changing inline text styles between bold, italic, underline, etc, and changing the alignment of text. You can also find options for some of these, including bold text, italic text, blockquotes, and alignment options as icons in the format bar.
            <h4 id="inserting" class="guides anchored">Inserting</h4>
            To insert a link into your post, select the icon that looks like a link. This will open up a window where you can paste in your URL and write out the text for the link. If you’d like to upload an image into your post, select the image icon in the format bar. This will open up a window with a “source” field. Selecting the file search icon will let you find the image file on your computer and upload it to your post. You can also add an image alt description and set the image size here.
            <h4 id="using-the-plain-text-editor" class="guides anchored">Using the plain text editor</h4>
            With the plain text editor, you can write your post and include HTML for the formatting. You may want to type your content out in your favorite text editing software and then paste the content into the post field, or you can write directly into the post box. Note that there isn’t a way to directly upload images into the post through the plain text editor.

            <h3 id="Medium">Using Medium</h3>
            Medium is a great blogging platform for those more interested in a clean and crisp writing environment. Medium also acts as a social network of authors and readers. Most importantly they allow users to own their own data, freely export it whenever, and syndicate to and from Medium. It is a great place for a new blogger.

<a href="readings/moduleone/winn.pdf">Maisha Winn Explores literacy spaces in out of school spaces in communities of color.>
<h3>The Tasks</h3>
<p>Complete the readings. The expectation is not that you memorize everythign I assign. I give you a text set. You will read some sources closer than others. It depends on what you are drawn to and what questions you seek to answer.</p>
<p>Write a blog post about your reactions to the reading. Reemmber you are taking a well defined genre like article analysis and applying to a relatively new genre of blogging. There will be some tensions in the design of your meaning.</p>
<p>Just remember no word count is required. You are to use exactly the words (or no words at all) to get your meaning across. You do need to draw on the sources you read. That is simply good writing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Task:</strong>You must share a defintion of literacy without using anywords.</p>
